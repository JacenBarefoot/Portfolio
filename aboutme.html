            <h3 class = "aboutme">Hello World! My name is Jacen Barefoot. I graduated Pontotoc High School in 2021. I am currently a student at <a style="text-decoration: none; color:blue" href="https://basecampcodingacademy.org/" target="_blank">Base Camp Coding Academy</a>. Before BCCA, I had no previous knowledge of any computer languages. However, I now have a deep appreciation for this field and for the code I help create. I greatly enjoy my work because I am constantly learning and taking on new challenges. I am very excited to see what the future holds for me and where my passion for development will lead.</h3>
